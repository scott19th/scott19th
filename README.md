### Hi there 👋

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 My name is Scott Clearie, I live in Edinburgh with my wife and our two beautiful children. 

👨‍🎓 I studied at [Edinburgh's Heriot Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/business.htm), graduting in 2009 with a MA (Hons) in Business

🍰 In 2010 I joined a pre-start up hospitality business called [Mimi's Bakehouse](https://mimisbakehouse.com). From humble beginnings we have grown the business to include seven physical sites, an online store and two wholesale plus agreements. Winning Scottish Baker of the Year Award in 2022.

🐍 My role has evolved as we have grown but has always encorporated business operations, project management and business analyses. The later of which led me to fall down the Python rabbit hole and I have experience in various libraries including; Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Dash, etc. 

👨‍💻 I particularly enjoy using data to support better decision making at all levels within business, as well as automating labour intensive processes such as manual excel work into automated python scripts. In addition to Python I have some experience in SQL, Javacscript, HTML and Git. 

❤️ I have an interest in open source projects and their altruistic nature which is partly why I fell in love with python itself.

⛰️ Outside of coding I love hill walking, I am in the process of 'Munro Bagging' and have currently climbed 68 of Scotland's 282 highest peaks.
