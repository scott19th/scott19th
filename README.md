### Hi there 👋

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 My name is Scott Clearie, I live in Edinburgh with my wife and two beautiful children. 

👨‍🎓 I studied at Edinburgh's Heriot Watt University, graduting in 2009 with a MA (Hons) in Business

🍰 In 2010 I joined a pre-start up hospitality business called Mimi's Bakehouse. From humble beginnings we have grown the business to include seven physical sites, an online store and two wholesale plus agreements. We won Scottish Baker of the Year Award in 2022.

🐍 My role has evolved as we have grown but has always been focused on business operations, growth projects and business analyses. The later of which led me to fall down the rabbit hole of Python code and have experience in various libraries including; Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Dash, etc. 

👨‍💻 I particularly enjoy using data to support better decision making at all levels as well as automating labourious processes often in excel into automated python scripts. In addition to Python I have some experience in SQL, Javacscript, HTML and Git. 

❤️ I am have an interest in open source projects, like python itself and love the altruistic nature of the many who write code for the benifit of others.

⛰️ Outside of coding I love hill walking, I am in the process of 'Munro Bagging' and have currently climbed 68 of Scotland's 282 highest peaks.
